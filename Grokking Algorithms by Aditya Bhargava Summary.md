# Chapter I
## Introduction to Algorithms

- Binary search is a lot faster than simple search.
- O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster once the list of items you’re searching through grows.
- Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds.
- Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.
- Algorithm times are written in Big O notation.

# Chapter II
## Selection Sort

- Your computer’s memory is like a giant set of drawers.
- When you want to store multiple elements, use an array or a list.
- With an array, all your elements are stored right next to each other.
- With a list, elements are strewn all over, and one element stores
the address of the next one.
- Arrays allow fast reads.
- Linked lists allow fast inserts and deletes.
- All elements in the array should be the same type (all ints,
all doubles, and so on).

# Chapter III
## Recursion

- Recursion is when a function calls itself.
- Every recursive function has two cases: the base case
and the recursive case.
- A stack has two operations: push and pop.
- All function calls go onto the call stack.
- The call stack can get very large, which takes up a lot of memory.

# Chapter IV
## Quicksort

- D&C works by breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller
pieces. If you’re using D&C on a list, the base case is probably an
empty array or an array with one element.
- If you’re implementing quicksort, choose a random element as the
pivot. The average runtime of quicksort is O(n log n)!
- The constant in Big O notation can matter sometimes. That’s why
quicksort is faster than merge sort.
- The constant almost never matters for simple search versus binary
search, because O(log n) is so much faster than O(n) when your list
gets big.

# Chapter V
## Hash Tables

- Hash tables are already implemented in most common programming languages.
- For built-in hash tables, assume average case performance: constant time.
- Hash tables are a powerful data structure because they’re so fast and they let you model data in a different way.
- You can make a hash table by combining a hash function with an array.
- Collisions are bad. You need a hash function that minimizes collisions.
- Hash tables have really fast search, insert, and delete.
- Hash tables are good for modeling relationships from one item to another item.
- Once your load factor is greater than .07, it’s time to resize your hash table.
- Hash tables are used for caching data (for example, with a web server).
- Hash tables are great for catching duplicates.
